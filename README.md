# -Tourism_Website_Development
I developed a comprehensive tourism website using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Bootstrap, with data managed in phpMyAdmin and powered by XAMPP. The website is divided into three main sections:

Admin Dashboard: A secure, login-protected dashboard where administrators can input, edit, or delete data, which then updates dynamically on the user-facing site. It includes an overview of inputted data and an integrated database management system.

User Interface: The user-facing website displays the data entered in the dashboard, with features like embedded YouTube videos, a suggestion box for visitor feedback, dropdown navigation, and a "Featured Destinations" section. This section dynamically pulls options such as Tourist Spots, Hotels, and Restaurants, with counts driven directly from the database.

Database Management: Built with phpMyAdmin, the database (named "pesonajawa") securely stores user and site data. User data is managed with high security standards to ensure accuracy and information protection.

This project showcases my abilities in full-stack web development, database management, and UI/UX design to enhance user engagement and streamline administrative processes.
